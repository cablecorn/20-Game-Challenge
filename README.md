Hello!

This is currently my go at the 20 Game Challenge that has circled the internet.

I am currently a computer science student trying to learn more about game development, 
data structures, the whole shabang, so these games won't necessarily be perfect at my
first go around. However, I am really driven to try my best with these projects and 
eventually finish the product (as my graveyard of unfinished products has grown quickly
recently)

My main method of making these games is using the Raylib library as I find it to be some
good practice at both low-level programming (compared to using a game engine) and also I
just really enjoy this library.

Feel free to play around on here, and I hope to keep updating as I learn more!
